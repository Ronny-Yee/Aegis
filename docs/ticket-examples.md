# Worked Ticket Examples — Aegis Response Format in Practice

Four anonymized ticket walk-throughs in the canonical §4 response format. Each shows the full Verdict → What to check first → Step-by-step fix → PowerShell (for reference only) → ⚠️ Risk warning → ✅ Verification checklist → 📝 Jira-ready note arc. All identifying data is placeholder-only.

## Execution boundary

These worked examples are planning/reference material only. They do not authorize state changes, and copying a procedure from this file is prohibited. Use the exact canonical command named at each preview notice; that command must resolve the target and require its own action-specific exact confirmation immediately before its one action. Generic `yes`, `proceed`, or approval of a ticket plan is never sufficient.

## Example 1 — Hybrid AD user can't sign in to M365

**Ticket:** "[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME] ([UPN]) says their password isn't working in Outlook. Worked yesterday."

### Verdict
Almost certainly an Entra Connect sync lag after an on-prem password change, or the on-prem AD account is locked.

### What to check first
1. Entra → Users → [UPN] → Sign-in logs (last 24h) — look for "AccountLocked" or "InvalidUserNameOrPassword."
2. AD Users & Computers → [UPN] → Account tab — is **Account is locked out** checked?
3. AD Connect server → was the password changed in on-prem AD in the last 30 min?

### Step-by-step fix

> **PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-signin-remediation]:** Use `/password-reset` for an account unlock or password action and `/ad-connect` for a sync request. This example does not authorize either change.

1. If AD shows the account locked: AD Users & Computers → right-click [UPN] → **Unlock Account**.
2. If sign-in logs show "wrong password" but AD looks fine: confirm the user is typing the *current* password (not their old one).
3. If they reset on-prem recently and it hasn't propagated: force a delta sync on the AD Connect server (PS block below).
4. Ask the user to wait 2 minutes, close Outlook completely, reopen.

### PowerShell — for reference only
<details>
<summary>Force Entra Connect delta sync</summary>

```powershell
# Plain English: forces an incremental sync from on-prem AD to Entra ID. Run on the AD Connect server.
# PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-delta-sync-ps]: Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
# Delta = only changes since last sync (~30 sec). Initial = full sync (slow, rare).
```
</details>

### ⚠️ Risk warning
Unlock and connector sync are state changes and require their canonical gates. Do **not** reset the password as the first move — if the issue is sync lag, a reset just adds another sync round-trip.

### ✅ Verification checklist
- Sign-in logs show a successful authentication after the fix
- Outlook reconnects without prompting again
- User confirms by replying to the ticket

### 📝 Jira-ready note
> Resolved [date/time]. Root cause: on-prem AD account was locked from repeated bad-password attempts; password itself was current. Fix: unlocked in ADUC, no sync needed. User confirmed successful sign-in. Time spent: ~5 min.

## Example 2 — MFA reset after lost/replaced phone

**Ticket:** "[FIRST_NAME] got a new phone, can't sign in to M365 because MFA is asking for the old Authenticator app."

### Verdict
Need to clear all registered MFA methods, then have the user re-register Authenticator at aka.ms/mfasetup.

### What to check first
1. Entra → Users → [UPN] → Authentication methods — list everything registered.
2. Protection → Conditional Access → Policies — any policy require *MFA from a trusted device* that would block initial registration?
3. Confirm with the user that you're talking to the actual person (callback to a known good number — social engineering risk on MFA resets is real).

### Step-by-step fix

> **PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-mfa-remediation]:** Use `/mfa-issue` for method deletion or session revocation and `/conditional-access` for any policy exception. This example does not authorize either action.

1. Entra ID → Users → [UPN] → **Authentication methods** → delete every entry (Microsoft Authenticator, phone, alternate phone, app passwords).
2. Tell the user: go to **aka.ms/mfasetup** on their new phone, sign in, follow the prompts to register Authenticator.
3. Add a phone-number SMS fallback after primary registration (Authentication methods → + Add → Phone).
4. If a CA policy blocks them before they can register, see ⚠️ below.

### PowerShell — for reference only
<details>
<summary>List + remove MFA methods via Graph (rarely needed; portal is faster)</summary>

```powershell
# Plain English: lists the user's registered authentication methods. Read-only.
Get-MgUserAuthenticationMethod -UserId "[UPN]"
# PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-mfa-method-remove-ps]: Remove-MgUserAuthenticationMethod -UserId "[UPN]" -AuthenticationMethodId $methodId
# The method-specific reviewed action must still route through `/mfa-issue`.
# This reference performs no removal; use `/mfa-issue` for an action-local gate.
```
</details>

### ⚠️ Risk warning

> **PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-ca-exception]:** A Conditional Access exclusion is a separate high-risk policy action. Route it to `/conditional-access`; this example cannot approve or execute it.

If a Conditional Access policy requires "MFA from a compliant/trusted device" and the user has *no* registered method, they'll be stuck. **Temporary exception — high risk:** exclude [UPN] from that one CA policy, let them register, re-add to the policy. Document the exception in the Jira ticket, set a reminder to confirm re-inclusion within 24h.

### ✅ Verification checklist
- Authentication methods list shows the new Authenticator registration (and SMS fallback)
- User signs in fresh on their phone and gets the new push
- CA exclusion (if used) is reverted

### 📝 Jira-ready note
> Resolved [date/time]. Cleared all auth methods in Entra, directed user to aka.ms/mfasetup. New Authenticator registered + SMS fallback. CA exclusion not needed. User signed in successfully. Time spent: ~10 min.

## Example 3 — Remove license for departing user (destructive)

**Ticket:** "[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME]'s last day was yesterday. Remove their M365 Business Premium license."

### Verdict
Standard offboarding step. **Destructive-action gate fires** — `/license-audit` must require the target-bound exact phrase immediately before removal.

### What to check first
1. M365 admin → Users → Active users → [UPN] → confirm this is the right person (check display name + department).
2. Confirm their mailbox conversion status — if not yet converted to shared, removing the license will start the 30-day mailbox deletion clock.
3. Record whether sign-in is already blocked. If not, route the account block to `/offboard` as a separate gated action.

### Step-by-step fix

> **PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-offboard-license]:** Use `/offboard` to verify sequencing and `/license-audit` for the separate license action. Each command must display its resolved target and action-specific phrase; this example supplies no approval.

1. Confirm the mailbox and OneDrive prerequisites in `/offboard`. Generic `yes` or `proceed` is invalid for license removal.
2. Invoke `/license-audit` for the resolved [UPN] and [SKU_ID]; complete only the confirmation generated for that exact action.
3. Verify: M365 admin → Billing → Licenses → confirm the seat returned to the pool.
4. If mailbox conversion is required, return to `/offboard` and run it as a separate gated action before license removal.

### PowerShell — for reference only
<details>
<summary>Remove license via Graph — bulk-safe</summary>

```powershell
# Plain English: removes the M365 Business Premium SKU from the user. -RemoveLicenses takes a SkuId.
# PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-license-remove-ps]: Set-MgUserLicense -UserId "[UPN]" -RemoveLicenses @("[SKU_ID]") -AddLicenses @()
# ⚠️ This is the destructive line — flagged by the script-safety scanner.
# Validate [SKU_ID] inside `/license-audit`; this commented block cannot run.
```
</details>

### ⚠️ Risk warning
**Destructive — action-local gate required.** Requester authorization is a prerequisite, not execution approval. `/license-audit` must resolve [UPN] and [SKU_ID] and require the exact generated phrase immediately before removal. After removal, the user's OneDrive becomes inaccessible (transfer ownership *first*), and the mailbox starts a 30-day deletion clock if not already shared. This is irreversible past 30 days.

### ✅ Verification checklist
- License count in M365 admin → Billing shows the seat returned
- User's Active users entry shows no licenses
- Mailbox status confirms shared (if applicable)
- OneDrive ownership transferred to manager (separate step)

### 📝 Jira-ready note
Use this completed-state form only after every item below has the stated read-back. If any action was not performed or its state is unknown, record the verified subset plus `UNKNOWN/POSSIBLY CHANGED` and the next owner instead.

> [Only after all cited checks pass] Resolved [date/time]. License removal for [UPN] was verified under the exact user/SKU gate after requester authorization. Mailbox Shared state and manager delegation were read back. OneDrive manager access was verified. Source-authoritative sign-in containment was already verified. Billing read-back showed the seat returned to the pool. Time spent: [X] min.

## Example 4 — "Internet is slow" at [@Aegion_SITE_2]

**Ticket:** "Whole office at [@Aegion_SITE_2] says internet is crawling since this morning."

### Verdict
Site-wide symptom — check WAN uplink and AP load before touching individual clients.

### What to check first
1. Meraki dashboard → Security & SD-WAN → Appliance status → [@Aegion_SITE_2] uplink — current throughput vs baseline, packet loss, latency.
2. Meraki → Network-wide → Event log — any uplink flaps in the last 4h?
3. [@Aegion_ISP] status page — any reported incident in the area?
4. Wireless → Access points — client count per AP. Anything over 25-30 = oversubscription.

### Step-by-step fix

> **PREVIEW ONLY [ticket-network-remediation]:** Keep diagnostics in this example read-only. Route traffic-shaping changes to `/wifi-issue` or `/lan-wan`, and route uplink/VPN cutovers to `/meraki-site-vpn`; this example does not authorize those changes.

1. If uplink shows packet loss or high latency: collect a sanitized 4h event-log summary for an operator-authorized [@Aegion_ISP] escalation. This example does not contact or submit to the provider.
2. If uplink is clean but an AP is overloaded: identify the AP, check if a non-work device pulled a huge download (Network-wide → Clients → sort by usage).
3. If it's clearly a single user/device hogging bandwidth: plan the desired traffic-shaping change, then route it to `/wifi-issue` or `/lan-wan` for separate review.
4. If nothing obvious: record the proposed failover target and rollback, then route the cutover to `/meraki-site-vpn` for separate review.

### ⚠️ Risk warning
This example cannot schedule or reboot an MX. Any reboot requires a separate operator-owned maintenance runbook because it interrupts the entire site.

### ✅ Verification checklist
- Meraki dashboard shows uplink throughput/latency back at baseline
- Speed test from a [@Aegion_SITE_2] client matches expected fiber speed
- User from the original ticket confirms speed is normal

### 📝 Jira-ready note
> Resolved [date/time]. Root cause: [@Aegion_ISP] confirmed a fiber-loop fault in the area, resolved at [time]. Meraki dashboard shows uplink back to baseline. Confirmed with reporter at [@Aegion_SITE_2]. No reboot needed. Vendor case: [ISP_CASE_#]. Time spent: ~20 min (mostly waiting on ISP).

## Appendix — Daily Ticket Template (moved from CLAUDE.md, v8.3)

When a full Jira ticket is pasted and the operator wants the complete work-up (including a user reply and an escalation point), use this fuller structure instead of the default Response Format:

- **Ticket read** — the issue in plain English
- **Likely cause** — top 1-3 causes
- **First checks** — in order
- **Execution steps** — clear admin steps
- **Escalation point** — when to escalate to MSP, vendor, ISP, or leadership
- **Verification** — how to prove it's resolved
- **User reply** — short message the operator can send to the user
- **Jira note** — clean internal ticket note

The default Response Format (Verdict → checks → fix → risk → verification → Jira note) remains the standard for any IT question; this template is the variant for a pasted raw ticket needing the full package end to end.
