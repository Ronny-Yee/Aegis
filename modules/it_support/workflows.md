# IT Support Workflows

## Execution boundary

This module is planning/reference only and never authorizes a state change. For execution, invoke the exact canonical command named by each preview notice. The destination command must independently show the resolved target, effect, scope, reversibility, checkpoint/rollback, and an action-specific exact confirmation immediately before its one action. Approval of a workflow or a generic `yes`/`proceed` is never sufficient.

Complete end-to-end procedures for the highest-frequency IT support tasks.

## WF-01 — New User Onboarding (Hybrid AD)

### Prerequisites
- Full name, job title, department, manager, start date confirmed
- Device type and license type decided

### Step 1 — Create Account in On-Prem Active Directory

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-new-user-portal]:** Route account creation to `/new-user`; this procedure cannot create an identity.

**ADUC (GUI):**
1. Open `Active Directory Users and Computers` on the domain controller or RSAT machine
2. Navigate to the correct OU for the department
3. Right-click → New → User
4. First name: `[FIRST_NAME]` · Last name: `[LAST_NAME]`
5. User logon name: `[first.last]@[@Aegion_DOMAIN]`
6. Set a temporary password → check `User must change password at next logon`
7. Click Finish → right-click the new account → Properties → fill in:
   - General: Display name, description
   - Organization: Title, Department, Manager

<details>
<summary>PowerShell (for reference)</summary>

```powershell
# Create user in on-prem Active Directory
# Run on a machine with the RSAT AD module installed
Import-Module ActiveDirectory  # Load the AD management module

# This identity-creation template is intentionally commented and cannot run when pasted.
# $TemporaryPassword = Read-Host "Enter the temporary password" -AsSecureString
# PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-user-create]: New-ADUser `
#   -Name "[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME]" `
#   -GivenName "[FIRST_NAME]" `
#   -Surname "[LAST_NAME]" `
#   -SamAccountName "[first.last]" `
#   -UserPrincipalName "[first.last]@[@Aegion_DOMAIN]" `
#   -Title "[JOB_TITLE]" `
#   -Department "[DEPARTMENT]" `
#   -Manager "[MANAGER_USERNAME]" `
#   -Path "OU=[DEPARTMENT],DC=[@Aegion_DOMAIN_SHORT],DC=org" `
#   -AccountPassword $TemporaryPassword `
#   -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true `
#   -Enabled $true
# Remove-Variable TemporaryPassword
```
</details>

### Step 2 — Sync to Entra ID

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-sync-portal]:** Route the resolved connector and sync type to `/ad-connect`; this workflow cannot initiate a sync.

1. Review the inert PowerShell reference below; route any actual cycle to `/ad-connect`.

<details>
<summary>PowerShell — Force sync</summary>

```powershell
# Force Entra Connect to sync immediately (only changes, not full sync)
Import-Module ADSync           # Load the AD sync module
# PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-delta-sync]: Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
```
</details>

2. Wait 3–5 minutes
3. Verify: Entra → Identity → Users → All users — confirm new account appears

### Step 3 — Assign License

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-license-portal]:** Route the resolved [UPN] and SKU to `/license-audit`; this workflow cannot assign a license.

1. admin.microsoft.com → Users → Active users → find `[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME]`
2. Click the user → **Licenses and apps** tab
3. Check `Microsoft 365 Business Premium` (or appropriate license)
4. Click **Save changes**
5. Verify: Licenses tab shows license as `Assigned`

### Step 4 — Add to Groups

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-group-portal]:** Route security-group membership to `/group-membership-audit` and distribution-list membership to `/distribution-list`; each is a separate action.

1. Entra → Identity → Groups → All groups
2. Find the department security group → Members → Add members → search `[FIRST_NAME]`
3. Add to distribution lists: EAC → Recipients → Groups → [DL name] → Members → Add

### Step 5 — Set Up MFA

1. Direct user to `aka.ms/mfasetup` after first sign-in
2. User registers Microsoft Authenticator app
3. Verify: Entra → Users → [UPN] → Authentication methods — should show at least one method

### Step 6 — Enroll Device in Intune

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-device-enrollment]:** Route enrollment or rename actions to `/new-device-setup`; this workflow cannot change a device.

- **Windows:** Sign in with work account during setup → auto-enrolls if Azure AD Join is configured
- **iPhone:** See `.claude/commands/enroll-ios.md`
- **Android:** See `.claude/commands/enroll-android.md`
- Verify: Intune → Devices → All devices — device appears with user as owner
- Rename device: Intune → [device] → Rename → use format `DT-[FirstName],[LastName]` or `LT-`

### Step 7 — Assign Phone Extension (if needed)

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-phone-extension]:** Route extension creation or assignment to `/unite-extension-create`; this workflow cannot change the voice system.

1. [@Aegion_VOIP] admin portal → Users → Manage users → Add user
2. Assign extension number and voicemail PIN
3. Assign to user's device

### Verification Checklist
```
[ ] User appears in Entra ID
[ ] License assigned — M365 apps showing as active
[ ] User can sign in at office.com
[ ] MFA registered
[ ] Device enrolled and visible in Intune
[ ] Correct groups/DLs assigned
[ ] Phone extension active (if applicable)
[ ] Welcome message sent; temporary credentials handed off through an approved secure channel
```

## WF-02 — User Offboarding

Manager and HR authorization is a prerequisite only; it does not authorize any state change. Invoke `/offboard`, keep each action separate, and stop on the first failure or unexpected state.

### Step 1 — Block Sign-In (Immediate)

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-block]:** Route the resolved account block to `/offboard`; this step cannot change sign-in state.

1. Entra → Identity → Users → `[UPN]` → Edit properties
2. `Block sign in` = Yes → Save
3. Verifies: new cloud authentication is blocked; existing access tokens and app-issued sessions require the separate revocation/expiry checks below

### Step 2 — Request Entra Refresh-Token and Browser-Cookie Revocation

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-sessions]:** Route the resolved session-revocation action to `/offboard`; this step cannot revoke sessions.

1. Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → Revoke sessions
2. The request invalidates Entra refresh tokens and browser cookies after propagation. Current access tokens and app-issued sessions may persist until expiry or application enforcement.

### Step 3 — Reset Password

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-password]:** Route the resolved password action to `/password-reset`; this step cannot reset a password.

- Resolve `OnPremisesSyncEnabled` first. A synchronized identity resets at the authoritative on-premises AD account; only a verified cloud-only identity uses the Microsoft 365 admin reset path.
- Do not share this password — it is a lockout action, not a handoff

### Step 4 — Clear MFA Methods

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-mfa]:** Route each resolved method deletion to `/mfa-issue`; this step cannot remove authentication methods.

1. Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → Authentication methods
2. Delete all registered methods

### Step 5 — Convert or Close Mailbox

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-mailbox]:** Route conversion to `/shared-mailbox` and delegation to `/mailbox-permissions` as separate gated actions; this step cannot perform either change.

- **Convert to shared (if manager needs access):**
  EAC → Recipients → Mailboxes → `[UPN]` → Convert to shared mailbox
  Then: Delegation tab → Full Access → Add manager
- **Or set auto-reply:**
  EAC → Mailboxes → `[UPN]` → Automatic replies → enable + set message

### Step 6 — Remove Licenses

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-license]:** Route each resolved [UPN]/SKU removal to `/license-audit`; this step cannot remove a license.

⚠️ Warning — shared mailbox remains accessible without license only up to 50 GB.
1. admin.microsoft.com → Users → `[UPN]` → Licenses and apps
2. Uncheck all licenses → Save changes

### Step 7 — Remove from Groups

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-groups]:** Route security-group removals to `/group-membership-audit` and distribution-list removals to `/distribution-list`; each is separate.

1. Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → Groups → remove from all security groups and M365 groups
2. EAC → Distribution groups — remove from all DLs

### Step 8 — Transfer OneDrive

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-onedrive]:** Route the resolved transfer action to `/offboard`; this step cannot grant file access.

1. admin.microsoft.com → Users → `[UPN]` → OneDrive → Create link to files
2. Share link with manager or grant manager access via SharePoint admin

### Step 9 — Handle Device

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-device]:** Route a resolved work-owned wipe or BYOD retire action to `/device-wipe`; this step cannot change a device.

⚠️ Full Wipe is irreversible. Confirm device is work-owned before wiping.
- **Work-owned:** Intune → Devices → `[device]` → Wipe → confirm
- **BYOD:** Intune → Devices → `[device]` → Retire (removes work data only)

### Step 10 — Disable On-Prem AD Account

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-offboard-ad]:** Route the resolved AD disable/move action to `/offboard`; this step cannot change the directory account.

1. ADUC → find user → right-click → Disable Account
2. Move to `Disabled Users` OU

### Verification
```
[ ] Sign-in blocked in Entra
[ ] Revocation requested; refresh-token/browser-cookie propagation checked where observable
[ ] Password reset (unknown to anyone)
[ ] MFA methods deleted
[ ] Mailbox converted/forwarded/closed
[ ] Licenses removed
[ ] Groups and DLs cleared
[ ] OneDrive transferred
[ ] Device wiped or retired in Intune
[ ] On-prem AD account disabled and moved to Disabled OU
[ ] Jira ticket updated with all steps and timestamps
```

## WF-03 — MFA Reset (Lost/New Phone)

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-mfa-reset]:** Route method deletion to `/mfa-issue` and any policy exclusion to `/conditional-access` as separate gated actions. This workflow cannot perform either change.

1. Entra → Identity → Users → `[UPN]` → Authentication methods
2. Delete all registered methods
3. Tell user: go to `aka.ms/mfasetup` → register Authenticator on new device
4. If user can't sign in due to CA policy blocking before MFA setup:
   - Entra → Protection → Conditional Access → `[MFA policy]` → Exclusions → add user temporarily
   - Remove exclusion after MFA is re-registered (same session — do not leave open)

**Verify:** Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → Authentication methods — new method shows registered

---

## WF-04 — Password Reset

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-password-reset]:** Route cloud or hybrid password reset to `/password-reset`; route any forced connector sync separately to `/ad-connect`. This workflow cannot perform either action.

**Cloud-only user:**
1. admin.microsoft.com → Users → Active users → `[UPN]` → Reset password
2. Auto-generate → Force change at next sign-in

**Hybrid AD user (synced from on-prem):**
1. ADUC (on-prem) → find user → right-click → Reset Password
2. Set new temp password → check `User must change password at next logon`
3. Entra Connect syncs the change automatically (up to 30 min). A forced sync must use a separate reviewed `/ad-connect` runbook; this module provides no executable sync command.

**User also locked out of MFA:** Run WF-03 after password reset.

---

## WF-05 — Shared Mailbox Access Grant

> **PREVIEW ONLY [workflow-mailbox-delegation]:** Route the resolved mailbox, delegate, and permission to `/mailbox-permissions`; this workflow cannot grant access.

1. EAC → Recipients → Mailboxes → find `[SHARED_MAILBOX]`
2. Click mailbox → **Delegation** tab
3. Under **Full Access** → Add → search for `[USER_UPN]` → Save
4. Under **Send As** → Add → same user (if needed)

User will see the mailbox in Outlook within 20–30 minutes (no re-login needed after delegation syncs).

**Verify:** Have user open Outlook → File → Add account or check left nav for the shared mailbox name
