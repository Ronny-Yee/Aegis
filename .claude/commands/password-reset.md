# /password-reset

> **Execution boundary:** Read-only diagnostics remain available. Every state-changing line below is a non-executing preview unless an immediately adjacent `SAFETY GATE` names the target, effect, scope, reversibility, and exact confirmation. Unmarked mutations must move to a separate reviewed runbook before execution; do not click, paste, or run them from this command.

**Verdict:** In a hybrid environment, **on-prem AD is the source of authority for synced users** — reset there, then let Entra Connect sync. Cloud-only users reset directly in Entra. Use `[FIRST_NAME]` / `[UPN]` — never the real name.

## What to check first
- **Synced or cloud-only?** Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → "On-premises sync enabled" = Yes → synced.
- **Locked vs. forgotten?** ADUC → Account tab → "Unlock account" if locked.
- Any Conditional Access policy that could block re-login (see `/conditional-access`).

## Step-by-step fix (portal/GUI first)

<!-- SAFETY GATE [password-reset-synced-portal] -->
- **Target:** [first.last] mapped to [UPN]
- **Effect:** replace the authoritative on-prem AD password and require a change at next sign-in
- **Scope:** one verified synced identity; no cloud-side reset
- **Reversibility:** not reversible; another verified AD reset is required
- **Required confirmation:** Type exactly `RESET AD PASSWORD FOR [first.last] MAPPED TO [UPN]`.
- **Failure behavior:** Empty, declined, `yes`, or any other response means stop; no change is made.
**PORTAL ACTION [password-reset-synced-portal]:** Only the exact match authorizes the synced-user branch. Never reset both copies of a synced identity.

**Synced user (on-prem AD is authority):**
1. **ADUC** (`dsa.msc`) → find `[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME]` → right-click → **Reset Password**.
2. Set a temp password; check **"User must change password at next logon"**.
> **PREVIEW ONLY [password-account-unlock]:** Account unlock is a separate identity change and is not authorized by a password-reset phrase.
3. If locked, move account unlock into a separate reviewed action.
4. Wait for the normal sync cycle. A forced sync requires a separate reviewed `/ad-connect` runbook.
5. Confirm it reached cloud: Entra → Users → `[UPN]`.

**Cloud-only user:**
<!-- SAFETY GATE [password-reset-cloud-portal] -->
- **Target:** [UPN]
- **Effect:** replace the cloud password and require a change at next sign-in
- **Scope:** one verified cloud-only identity
- **Reversibility:** not reversible; another verified cloud reset is required
- **Required confirmation:** Type exactly `RESET CLOUD PASSWORD FOR [UPN]`.
- **Failure behavior:** Empty, declined, `yes`, or any other response means stop; no change is made.
**PORTAL ACTION [password-reset-cloud-portal]:** Only the exact match authorizes the cloud-only branch. Stop if on-premises sync is enabled.
1. **Microsoft 365 admin center** → Users → Active users → `[UPN]` → **Reset password**.
2. Auto-generate or set temp; check **"Require this user to change their password"**.

<!-- SAFETY GATE [password-session-revoke-portal] -->
- **Target:** [UPN]
- **Effect:** invalidate Microsoft Entra refresh tokens and browser session cookies
- **Scope:** Entra-managed refresh tokens and browser cookies for one user; current access tokens and app-issued sessions can persist until expiry
- **Reversibility:** not reversible; the user must authenticate again
- **Required confirmation:** Type exactly `REVOKE ENTRA SESSIONS FOR [UPN]`.
- **Failure behavior:** Empty, declined, `yes`, or any other response means stop; no change is made.
**PORTAL ACTION [password-session-revoke-portal]:** Only after the separate exact match, Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → **Overview** → **Revoke sessions**. A password-reset confirmation never authorizes this effect; verify after propagation.

**Combo case — MFA-locked too (new phone + forgotten password):** order matters.
1. Use the separate exact method-ID deletion gate in `/mfa-issue`; this command does not authorize deleting authentication methods.
2. **Then** reset the password (steps above).
3. **Then** the user re-registers at **aka.ms/mfasetup** on first sign-in (full flow incl. the CA gotcha: `/mfa-issue`).
Resetting the password first just walks the user into an MFA wall they can't pass — they sign in with the temp password and get prompted on a phone they no longer have.

## ⚠️ Risk warning
- `Revoke-MgUserSignInSession` invalidates Entra refresh tokens and browser cookies after propagation; current access tokens and app-issued sessions can persist until expiry.
- For a synced user, a cloud-side reset can be overwritten at next sync — always reset **on-prem** for synced users.

## ✅ Verification checklist
- [ ] User signs in with temp password and is forced to change it
- [ ] (Synced) change visible in Entra after sync — `Get-MgUser -UserId "[UPN]"`
- [ ] Entra session revocation completed and sign-in logs were checked after propagation; no claim is made about app-issued sessions
- [ ] MFA working, or re-registered via `/mfa-issue`
- [ ] Account not locked

## 📝 Jira-ready note
> Resolved [date/time]. Reset password for `[UPN]` ([synced via on-prem AD / verified cloud-only]). Temp password issued with force-change at next logon. Entra refresh-token/browser-cookie revocation [requested and checked after propagation / not requested]; current access tokens and app-issued sessions may persist until their own expiry. User confirmed sign-in + password change. Time spent: [X] min.
