# /group-membership-audit

> **Execution boundary:** Read-only diagnostics remain available. Every state-changing line below is a non-executing preview unless an immediately adjacent `SAFETY GATE` names the target, effect, scope, reversibility, and exact confirmation. Unmarked mutations must move to a separate reviewed runbook before execution; do not click, paste, or run them from this command.

**Verdict:** Two directions: **"who can do X?"** (members of `[GROUP]`) and **"what can [UPN] reach?"** (all of a user's groups). Watch for **nested** groups (members inherit access indirectly), **dynamic** groups (rule-based, can't edit members directly), and **stale** access left over from role changes/offboarding.

## What to check first
- Is it a security group (access), M365 group (collab), or DL (mail)? Synced from on-prem AD or cloud-only?
> **PREVIEW ONLY [group-dynamic-rule-reference]:** `Entra → Groups → [GROUP] → Membership type = Dynamic` is a read-only inspection path here. Changing the rule is a separate group-wide access mutation; route it to an action-specific runbook with a policy export, resolved group ID, exact rule digest, approval, and read-back.

## Step-by-step (portal first)

> **PREVIEW ONLY [group-membership-remediation]:** The state-changing path below is not authorized by this reference. Move the intended action to a separate reviewed runbook with resolved target, effect, scope, reversibility/checkpoint, and an action-specific exact confirmation.
1. **Members of a group:** Entra → Groups → `[GROUP]` → **Members** (and **Owners**). Export the list for the audit.
2. **A user's groups:** Entra → Users → `[UPN]` → **Groups** → full list (direct + via nested where shown). This is the access-review view for offboarding/role change.
3. **Nested groups:** open member groups to see inherited access; map the effective access.
4. **Dynamic groups:** Membership type Dynamic → review/adjust the **membership rule**; you can't add/remove members manually.
5. **Synced groups:** if "On-premises sync" = Yes, edit membership in **ADUC**, not Entra (cloud edits get overwritten at sync).
6. **Remediate stale access:** remove users who no longer need it (confirm with owner/manager).

<summary>PowerShell — for reference only</summary>

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Group.Read.All","User.Read.All","GroupMember.Read.All"  # read groups + members
# Members of a group
$g = Get-MgGroup -Filter "displayName eq '[GROUP]'"; Get-MgGroupMember -GroupId $g.Id -All | Select AdditionalProperties  # roster
# All groups a user belongs to (direct + transitive/nested)
Get-MgUserTransitiveMemberOf -UserId "[UPN]" | Select AdditionalProperties   # effective group access
```
</details>

## ⚠️ Risk warning
- Removing someone from a security group **revokes everything that group grants** — confirm scope with the owner before removing (could cut access to apps/files/SharePoint).
- For **synced** groups, change membership on-prem (ADUC) — cloud changes are overwritten at the next Entra Connect sync.
- Dynamic group "wrong members" = fix the rule; manual edits won't stick.

## ✅ Verification checklist
- [ ] Member list / user's group list exported for the record
- [ ] Nested + dynamic memberships accounted for (effective access mapped)
- [ ] Stale access removed (owner/manager confirmed)
- [ ] Synced groups edited on-prem; change visible in Entra after sync

## 📝 Jira-ready note
