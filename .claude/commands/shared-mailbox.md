# /shared-mailbox

> **Execution boundary:** Read-only diagnostics remain available. Every state-changing line below is a non-executing preview unless an immediately adjacent `SAFETY GATE` names the target, effect, scope, reversibility, and exact confirmation. Unmarked mutations must move to a separate reviewed runbook before execution; do not click, paste, or run them from this command.

**Verdict:** Shared mailboxes need **no license** under 50 GB. Manage in the new Exchange admin center (EAC). The two access types people confuse: **Send As** (looks like it came from the mailbox) vs **Send on Behalf** ("[USER] on behalf of [MAILBOX]").

## What to check first
- Does the mailbox exist? EAC → Recipients → Mailboxes → filter Shared.
- What does the user actually need: read, Send As, or Send on Behalf?

## Step-by-step fix (portal first — EAC: admin.exchange.microsoft.com)

> **PREVIEW ONLY [shared-mailbox-create-grant]:** The state-changing path below is not authorized by this reference. Move the intended action to a separate reviewed runbook with resolved target, effect, scope, reversibility/checkpoint, and an action-specific exact confirmation.

**Create:** EAC → Recipients → **Mailboxes → Add a shared mailbox** → name + alias `[MAILBOX]@[@Aegion_DOMAIN]`.

**Grant access:** open the shared mailbox → **Delegation**:
- **Read and manage (Full Access)** → add `[UPN]`. Auto-mapping adds it to their Outlook automatically.
- **Send As** → add `[UPN]` (sends *as* the mailbox).
- **Send on Behalf** → add `[UPN]` (sends *on behalf of*).

<!-- SAFETY GATE [shared-mailbox-convert-portal] -->
- **Target:** [UPN]
- **Effect:** convert the user mailbox to Shared without removing its license
- **Scope:** one mailbox verified below 50 GB with archive requirements reviewed
- **Reversibility:** reversible by converting the mailbox back to User
- **Required confirmation:** Type exactly `CONVERT MAILBOX [UPN] TO SHARED`.
- **Failure behavior:** Empty, declined, `yes`, or any other response means stop; no change is made.
**PORTAL ACTION [shared-mailbox-convert-portal]:** Only after the exact match, EAC → Mailboxes → `[UPN]` → **Others → Convert to shared mailbox**. License removal is a separate destructive action and is not authorized by this phrase.

## ⚠️ Risk warning
- Shared mailbox >50 GB or with In-Place Archive **needs a license** — don't strip the license if it's large/archived.
- Auto-mapping change can take time to appear in Outlook; a full re-add to profile may be needed.

## ✅ Verification checklist
- [ ] Mailbox shows under Recipients → Shared
- [ ] Delegate sees it in Outlook (auto-mapped) and can read
- [ ] Test Send As / Send on Behalf produces the expected From line
- [ ] (Converted) license removed only after confirming <50 GB
