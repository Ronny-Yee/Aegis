# /mailbox-permissions

> **Execution boundary:** Read-only diagnostics remain available. Every state-changing line below is a non-executing preview unless an immediately adjacent `SAFETY GATE` names the target, effect, scope, reversibility, and exact confirmation. Unmarked mutations must move to a separate reviewed runbook before execution; do not click, paste, or run them from this command.

**Verdict:** Three distinct rights people conflate: **Full Access** (open & read the mailbox), **Send As** (send *as* the mailbox), **Send on Behalf** (send *on behalf of*). Calendar/folder delegation is separate again. Grant the least that solves the ask.

## What to check first
- Whose mailbox (`[MAILBOX]`), which delegate (`[UPN]`), and what they actually need (read? send? calendar only?).
- EAC → Recipients → Mailboxes → `[MAILBOX]` → **Delegation** to see current grants.

## Step-by-step (portal first — EAC)

> **PREVIEW ONLY [mailbox-grant-portal]:** The state-changing path below is not authorized by this reference. Move the intended action to a separate reviewed runbook with resolved target, effect, scope, reversibility/checkpoint, and an action-specific exact confirmation.
1. EAC → Recipients → Mailboxes → `[MAILBOX]` → **Delegation**.
2. Grant what's needed:
   - **Read and manage (Full Access)** → add `[UPN]` (auto-maps into their Outlook).
   - **Send As** → add `[UPN]`.
   - **Send on Behalf** → add `[UPN]`.
3. **Calendar-only:** the owner shares the calendar in Outlook (Editor/Reviewer), or set folder-level permissions.
4. **Audit:** review the Delegation list; remove anyone who shouldn't have access (offboarding, role change).
<!-- SAFETY GATE [mailbox-permission-remove-portal] -->
- **Target:** [UPN] on [MAILBOX]
- **Effect:** remove Full Access while leaving other delegation unchanged
- **Scope:** one user and one mailbox
- **Reversibility:** reversible by granting Full Access again
- **Required confirmation:** Type exactly `REMOVE FULL ACCESS FOR [UPN] FROM [MAILBOX]`.
- **Failure behavior:** Empty, declined, `yes`, or any other response means stop; no change is made.
**PORTAL ACTION [mailbox-permission-remove-portal]:** Only after the exact match, remove `[UPN]` from **Full Access** on `[MAILBOX]` and re-read the Delegation list.

} else {
    throw "Confirmation did not match. No change was made."
}
```

## ⚠️ Risk warning
- Full Access lets the delegate read **everything** in the mailbox — confirm it's authorized (especially for exec/HR/finance mailboxes). Logging access grants is good hygiene.
- Removing permission during active use will drop the mailbox from the delegate's Outlook — expected; tell them.

## ✅ Verification checklist
- [ ] Delegate has exactly the right(s) requested — no more
- [ ] Send As / on-behalf produces the correct From line on a test send
- [ ] Full Access mailbox auto-maps (or re-add profile if delayed)
- [ ] Audit list reflects only authorized delegates
